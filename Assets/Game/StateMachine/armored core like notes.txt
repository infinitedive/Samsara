    Neutral

      Move - Walk and Run Cartesian
      Look - Limited by velocity magnitude and direction ???
      Jump - Normal
      Run - accelerates linearly
      Dash - Square + Move
        low velocity - quick dash can change velocity direction
        high velocity - quick dash not changing velocity direction
      Tumble - Slide / Hug Surface
      Aim Acceleration - Normal
      Fire - Normal
      Aim Down - Normal
      Switch Weapons - Normal
      Fast Fall / Leap - Leap trajectory affected by velocity + speed cooefficient
      Lock on / Refocus - Limited by Look range

    Grappling

      Move - Minor xz position influence
