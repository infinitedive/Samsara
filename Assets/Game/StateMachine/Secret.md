I can only really speak with a keyboard. I think this is the case for most people actually. We live in a time when free speech is restricted, and the only place people can really express themselves are in virtual spaces on the internet. In addition, almost all social phenomena nowadays begins in the virtual space of group chats and social media. We've been removed from our locality, in a sense.

But throughout history, the most revolutionary ideas and expressions have been written down in text. In a sense, paper has always been a kind of memory enhancing technology which allows for more complex and nuanced messaging. Maybe the shift in medium from paper to screens has more to do with the attention problems than we realize.

In a similar way to how people feel as if they are only themselves while on certain drugs, there is a certain kind of identity crisis that one can struggle with when trying to consolidate "virtual" reality with your lived reality, whether that virtual space comes from your own imagination or some shared online space.

Combine this with conditions such as ADD or autism or just the increase in mental illness in general, and you have a large amount of people who feel always as if they can and should escape the present reality for a better one. The luxury of technology today affords us a whole bunch of new determental and crippling habits and belief systems that people in less advanced societies could never have imagined. In the past, your social dimension was limited mostly by location and culture, and people had to make it work with people who weren't perfect and developed deeper relationships with those people over time. Compared to now, when the first impulse to quit or commit to something amounts to swiping left or right, there must have been a much greater sense of weight and importance to the world outside of the medium consisting of words and images.

I always thought that one day, although I am stuck here playing videogames and surfing the internet, I will get out of this psychological hole and make it back to a world that felt real. As an adult, those days spent and the friends I made in virtual places seem more real to me than life does now. To be honest, I feel sick all the time.

But let's visualize a timeline, because it is unproductive to be simply sentimental about these things. Out of all methods of conveying information, the time tested best method is storytelling.

I'll be honest, it is kind of hard to remember. But in a way, the past doesn't matter nearly as much as how you remember it. Of course, I'm reminded of how my dad said that I don't remember my childhood correctly. Isn't that sad?
