saeed

I feel ashamed, again and again
Nothing to give, and no one to blame
During the day, I guess I'm OK
(x2)
I feel ashamed, again and again
Nothing to give, and no one to blame
During the day, I guess I'm OK
(x2)
I feel ashamed, again and again
Nothing to give, and no one to blame
During the day, I guess I'm OK
At night
I sit by your side
Waiting for you, to give me a sign
I'm counting the days
And have nothing to say
aaahhh!!! I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies you've been feeding my veins
I've got nothing to say to you
I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies I've been beating and beating and beating myself
I feel ashamed, again and again
nothing to give, no one to blame
during the day, I guess I'm OK
At night, I sit by your side
Waiting for you, to give me a sign
I'm counting the days, and have nothing to say
aaahhh!!! I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies you've been feeding my veins
I've got nothing to say to you
I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies I've been beating and beating and beating myself
I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies you've been feeding my veins
I've got nothing to say to you
I hope I can chill and stay the same
Stop the bleed inside and feel again
Cut the chain of lies I've been beating myself without nothing to say to o
nothing to say to you
